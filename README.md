# Machine_Learning_Project

The goal of this project is to create an interactive visualization that is centered around a machine learning model used to help identify birds in the city of Houston.

# Planning the Project 

In order to start this project, we identified high level items that needed to be determined: 

1. Create and Clean a dataset 
2. Develop Train and Test Sets and Begin the Model 
3. Modify the parameters of the model to increase accuracy 
4. Create a website to display information about our model 
5. Embed a Flask app to add interactive features to the website allowing for independent uploads of photos 

# DataSet 

To obtain a dataset, we used the Flickr API. This allowed us to predetermine a list of birds we wanted to model and also predetermine a size for all photos. 

As with any dataset, the data had to be cleaned to ensure that we would get reasonable results. Some of the parameters we considered included: 
- The amount of noise in the photo (How much space the bird took up)
- Whether the photo was of the bird itself 
- The number of birds in the photo
- Large distracting features in the photo 

Once the data was cleaned, we moved onto the data modeling
